# Requests for SoCS Rep

## About
This is a page for you to open a ticket for me (the School Rep) should you have any requests or questions. It's a busy time, and a time where I do get an overload of questions so this helps me to better track requests and ensure that I do not miss any DMs. The URL to this page is <[tinyurl.com/AskSoCSRep23](tinyurl.com/AskSoCSRep23)> if you would like to share the page. 

## Procedure
1. To open a new ticket, first go to the `Issues` page;
2. Check that the question/request you're about to make has not already been asked/made;
3. Open a new issue with the following convensions
   a. Title: <GEN/COURSE_NAME/EXAM> - <Brief Title> (eg. GEN - SoCS Online is down; TAD - AE Grades & Feedback Not Out; EXAM - 2022 Paper Not Available)
   b. Body: Input your question/request; include screenshots if required;
   c. Body: End with your Discord username *including the #XXXX* where XXXX are 4 digits (eg. @awn0110#4730) or Student Email
4. I will respond as quickly as I can. The ideal is within 2 hours during waking hours.

## Guidelines
